Etch a Sketch App


NOTES FROM ODIN PROJECT:

Create a 16x16 grid of square divs using JavaScript & CSS Grid.

Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would.

Add a button which will clear the current grid and another button that sends the user a popup asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid. Once entered, the new grid should be generated in the same total space as before (e.g. 960px wide) so that you’ve got a new sketch pad. Set the limit for the user input to a maximum of 100. 

Add a button that erases what you have drawn as you mouse back over.

Add a button that changes the 'ink' to a completely random RGB value with every mouseover each square. 

Then try having each pass just add another 10% of black to it so that only after 10 passes is the square completely black.
